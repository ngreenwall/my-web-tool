# What is this file?
# This file tells Git (your version control system) which files to ignore.
# Think of it like a "do not track" list. Some files should not be saved to GitHub.

# Example: If you have a file with your password, you do not want it on GitHub.
# You would add that file to this list so Git ignores it.

# Dependencies (when you add React later)
# These are like toolboxes that help you build things
node_modules/
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# Environment variables (secret information)
# Like passwords, API keys, or settings that are private
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local

# Build outputs (finished products)
# When you build your app, it creates these folders
build/
dist/
out/

# IDE files (your editor settings)
# These are just for your computer, not for the project
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo

# OS files (computer system files)
# These are created by your computer, not by you
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Logs (error reports)
# These are just temporary files that show what went wrong
*.log
